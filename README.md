## What Is the Aviator App?

The Aviator app is a mobile version of the popular crash game, Aviator,
developed by Spribe. The game's main attraction is its simplicity and
the ability to win large payouts based on the timing of your cash-out
decisions. In the game, a plane flies upwards, and you need to cash out
before the plane crashes. The longer you wait, the higher the
multiplier, but the risk of losing your bet increases as the plane gets
closer to crashing.
